# GI SP0256-AL2 Speech Synthesis Simulator

A crude attempt at a GI SP0256-AL2 speech synthesis simulator. This project is primarily for experimentation and lacks usability and extensive language processing rules. It currently outputs a WAV file of poor quality.

This simulator prompts you for text input and outputs a WAV file that simulates the speech synthesis capabilities of the GI SP0256-AL2 chip by concatenating existing WAV samples. It uses rudimentary language processing rules.

This project is for experimental purposes only and not supported.
